1 - kyzis:
EX mode, type some characters, move the cursor to a previous position and type a new character, character is appended at end of line instead of cursor position !

3 - kyzis:
initial display of the cursor is wrong ...

4 - both lib and gui have a currentView that needs to be keep synced.. improve that
5 - vim displays 'x,0-1' when positionned on the first char of an empty line : do the same
