Yzis uses CMake for managing the build.

To get started, create a directory build, enter it and type:
cmake ..

CMake will start to look for the dependencies. If all of them are satisfied,
it will generate Makefiles.

You can pass options and variables to CMAKE with the -D flag:
cmake -DENABLE_NYZIS=false to disable for example the nyzis building.

This list of available options are:
- ENABLE_NYZIS: build the ncurses based frontend
- ENABLE_QYZIS: build the Qt frontend
- ENABLE_LIBYZISRUNNER: build the frontend used to test the library
- CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE: default is not set, allows to see the exact
  compilation lines. Very useful when something does not work, to understand
  what cmake is actually doing.
- ENABLE_DOCUMENTATION: generate the documentation when building (doxygen
  apidoc)

Yzis depends on the following libraries:
- Qt, for its engine (the gui part of Qt is not used)
- Lua 5.0 for its scripting engine
- optional: libmagic for recognising file types and associating the correct
  syntax file
- ncurses, which is mandatory when building the nyzis

For Qt, you need to have the QTDIR environment variable pointing to Qt,
version above 4.0

For Lua, you need to have it installed in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib, or to
specify it with the following variables:
- LIBLUA50_INCLUDE_DIR: place to find lua.h
- LIBLUALIB50_INCLUDE_DIR: place to find lualib.h (usually, the same)
- LIBLUA50_LIBRARIES: place to find liblua.so
- LIBLUALIB50_LIBRARIES: place to find liblualib.so (usually, the same)

Building on windows:
====================

On windows, the compiler must be mingw. When you install Qt 4 for windows, Qt
proposed to download and install mingw automatically.

When using cmake, you need to specify the generator as mingw:
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" .. 

You will probably need to specify the lua libraries explicitely. My build
line on windows look like this:

cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DLIBLUA50_LIBRARIES="D:/program/Lua/LibLua.lib" -DLIBLUA50_INCLUDE_DIR="D:/program/Lua" -D LIBLUALIB50_INCLUDE_DIR="D:/program/Lua" -DLIBLUALIB50_LIBRARIES="d:/program/Lua/LibLuaLib.lib" -DENABLE_NYZIS=false -DENABLE_QYZIS=false -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=true ..
