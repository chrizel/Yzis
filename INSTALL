Yzis uses the CMake system to compile and install itself, just like KDE.

More detailed documentation on building Yzis can be found in the Yzis wiki at
http://wiki.yzis.org/index.php?title=Build_Yzis. You are strongly recommended
to read it (and improve it, if you find any mistakes or omissions).

Minimal build process:

	mkdir build # create a build directory
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	make install
