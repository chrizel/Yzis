trying to define what motion we will use (TYPES), how we will use them from command mode (command regexp) and how they will match on the text (motion)
the idea is to :
1 - detect a command in inputBuffer
2 - detect a motion in the same inputBuffer following the command we just found (done by each command which supports it i believe)
3 - let the command which is executed (in YZView for eg) call a static function in motion.cpp to calculate the result of the "motion" :
	which can be :
		- a length
		- a position in text
		- other things ?
