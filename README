Introduction:
=============
Yzis is a vi-compatible editor that is composed of a generic vi engine and 
independent GUI. It is developed in C++ and relies on QtCore for the some of the
background classes (lists and strings mainly). A KDE, Qt and ncurses gui
are available. More frontends are welcome. I would be happy to see a Gtk, MFC,
WxWidgets and XUL frontend added to the source tree.

Requirements:
=============
For more details about requirements and build instructions, see:
http://wiki.yzis.org/index.php?title=Build_Yzis


Planning and project status:
============================
We try to maintain the current state of the project and a planning on the
wiki:
http://wiki.yzis.org/

Documentation: 
==============
Most of the documentation is stored on the wiki: http://wiki.yzis.org  . Build
instructions, project status, ...  . And if you are missing something, the
magic of wiki allows you to add it yourself.

There is also a developer handbook http://doc.yzis.org for architecture design
and full API documentation.
