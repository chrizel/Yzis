To compile YZis, it's better to have TinyQ installed for performance improvment. You can use
the --with-tinyq-dir to indicate your TinyQ prefix.
However, you can use a full Qt (>3.x) to compile the whole YZis but that will slow down "yzis" (ncurses) startup
because the system has to load the whole Qt library.

In a near future we hope to drop TinyQ and just keep Qt (4.x), since Qt should be splitted into different libraries (thus dropping the need of TinyQ ;)
