- better key event system: medium
    Currently, key event is half based on a string containing the character,
    half-based on kind of meta-characters like <TAB> and <UP>. We need a
    better key event system, modelled after QKeyEvent. We can not use
    QKeyEvent itself because it is part of QtGui and we only depend on QtCore.

    YZKeyEvent should:
    + support modifier for ALT, CTRL, SHIFT
    + store the key being pressed
    + transform from and to a string that is compatible with vim, in the form
of <TAB>, <C-A>, <ESC>. We probably have more power than vim but we should be
compatible in terms of key sequence description.
    + modify YZSession::sendKeyEvent()
    + modify lua way of sending pseudo key event to yzis
    + modify command line way of passing key event strings to yzis

- more movements commands: easy
    Check that yzis has all the movement commands that vim enjoys.
    Write lua tests to validate that all the movements commands behave exactly
like in vim.
    Implement the missing commands.

- Lua 5.1: medium
    Yzis currently work with lua 5.0 . It will detect lua 5.1 and refuse to
    compile and link with it, because lua 5.1 changed the behaviour and syntax of
    few lua functions.

    One should read the doc of lua 5.0 and the doc of lua 5.1 , and add #ifdef
    in yzis code so that both are supported.

- vim displays 'x,0-1' when positioned on the first char of an empty line: do the same
- layout classes to handle geometry and windows positions, also add a layout manager to save 'profiles' ala konqueror
- nyzis: report meta, etc..
- implement open mode
- make / and ? motions to allow 'd/thing' to work
- implement a C-like Timer (SIGALARM) to dump swapfiles?
- yz configure -> G, should be slow, but gg then G should be faster (no?) //mm
