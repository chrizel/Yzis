This file references all known incompatibilities with Vi and Vim.
Please, don't bother us with 'why this command does not do like Vim does ?' before having 
look into mailing lists archives. I believe that most of the time, this discussion has already
happened before ;)
At the beginning of Yzis development it was clearly defined that we wanted some Vim commands to be 
handled more 'logically'.


	--- ==== Vi(m) incompatibilities ==== ---

1->'4o' normal command will open 4 new lines in yzis (Vi and Vim)
2->'dj' will delete from current cursor to the character below (Vi deletes 2 lines) (Vi and Vim)
3->'2d$' will do 'd$' (Vim deletes 2 lines) (Vi and Vim)
4->'Y' yank to end of line (Vim yank one line by default) (Vi and Vim)
5->'q' and '@' these commands work with registers : "aq start recording in register 'a', "a@ plays register 'a' contents (Vi and Vim)
6->'U' == redo, Vim's U fonctionnality is not implemented in yzis (Vi and Vim)
