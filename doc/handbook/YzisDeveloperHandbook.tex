\chapter{Introduction}

This handbook is aimed at developers wanting to work on Yzis. We will
explain here how to dig into the Yzis code, architecture details and
explanation about the tools we use.


\chapter{Technologies}
Yzis is not doing all of its own. Some external tools are used to help
build yzis. And Yzis is build on top of some other software. We describe
all of those in this chapter.

\section{cmake}
cmake is a replacement for the autotools ( autoconf/automake and such). We
decided to switch to cmake because the autotools are evil, and, moreover,
KDE officially switched to cmake. Yzis is quite close to kde, and follow
KDE decisions on such topic.
You can find more information about cmake on http://www.cmake.org

\section{subversion}
Subversion is a Software Configuration Management(SCM), or Source Control,
or Revision Control, or Version Control System (VCS). That is, subversion
is used to handle source files. It keeps the history of the changes to the
file and help the team to share the source.
Check out the subversion book to know more about this tool.

\item http://subversion.tigris.org/
\item http://svnbook.red-bean.com/
\end{itemize}

\section{Doxygen}
Doxygen is a tool which generates documentation from text inserted in the
code itself. This typically used to describe APIs.
See http://www.doxygen.org/

\section{Qt}
Yzis is built on top of the \emph{Qt} C++ library, which provides some
generic useful classes and some optional GUI widgets. \emph{Qt} is most
widely known as the basis for \emph{KDE}
See http://www.trolltech.com for more details.

\section{Lua}
Lua is a small footprint script language designed to be easily embedded in
applications. Yzis uses \emph{lua} for its main scripting language. See
http://www.lua.org.

\chapter{Startup guide}
This chapter explains how to get a fully usable environment to play with
Yzis source.

First you need to get the source. Of course, you could use the latest
tarball released, but it's probably outdated already. Moreover, you will
not be able to follow the changes made by the Yzis team.
Better use a svn checkout. 

\begin{verbatim}
svn co svn://svn.freenux.org/yzis/trunk yzis-trunk
cd yzis-trunk
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=/opt/kde4 -DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=debugfull
make
sudo make install
\end{verbatim}

You can use \verb+ccmake ../+ instead of the \verb+cmake+ line to get an
interface where you can configure variables.
Now, you should have the latest yzis compiled and installed.

If you intend to develop, it's probably a good idea to have the source
documentation available~: (from within the main directory \verb+yzis-trunk+)

\begin{verbatim}
doxygen yzis.doxy
\end{verbatim}

Then open a browser in the \verb+yzis-trunk/html/+ directory to get the
pages.

Before digging into the source, you should probably read the architecture
overview. And then.. go and read the source!
