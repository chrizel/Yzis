This is the stub code for the yzis kpart.

yzis_kpart compiles against the newest kdelibs svn version at the moment.
You cannot compile/link against KDE 4 beta2

The install target does not work right now. You have to perform a manual
installation:
1.) Compile the sources (yzis_kpart is disabled by default. Use
    -DENABLE_YZIS_KPART=ON to enable)
2.) Copy yzis_kpart.rc to $KDEDIR/apps/yzis_kpart and yzis_kpart.desktop to
    $KDEDIR/share/kde4/services/ (where $KDEDIR is the prefix of your
    installation)
3.) Copy $builddir/lib/yzis_kpart.so to $KDEDIR/lib/kde4/ (you have to do this
    every time you recompile the kpart)
    or
    Add your build directory to the variable $KDEDIRS and then run 
    kbuildsycoca4.
4.) Start kwrite/kate
5.) Choose "Kyzis" as you desired editor component:
    Settings->Choose Editor in kwrite
    Settings->Configure Kate->Application->General in kate
6.) Restart kate/kwrite
