This directory contains the tests for libyzis. Since a code editor is a key
component in software development, you expect it to be very robust. Yzis will
be, thanks to its (soon) very complete test suite.

The tests depend on cppunit, a test library that helps you organise test into
suites and fixutres. You can find cppunit on sourceforge (cppunit.sf.net) but
we provide it here as a convenience.

The tests are compiled with qmake or tmake. This provides very easy
compilation framework, without the burden of automake and co. Since they
depend solely on Qt and cppunit, this is not a problem.

To compile the tests, you need to first compile cppunit. You must execute the
following:
cd cppunit
qmake cppunit.pro -o Makefile
make

The first command should create a Makefile (you must have your QMAKESPEC
variable already set but this is very likely already the case) and the second
will compile cppunit into a static library and put it into cppunit/bin.

Now, you can compile the tests:
qmake tests.pro -o Makefile
make

This should create an executable runTests. It is stacitally linked to cppunit
and dynamically linked to libyzis. Running it will run all the test suites. It
is possible to select only one test suite to run or only one test of a test
suite.

PhilAsserts and PhilTestRunner are a small addition to cppunit that I use to
improve the writing of the tests and the reporting of errors.
