This directory contains the tests for libyzis. Since a code editor is a key
component in software development, you expect it to be very robust. Yzis will
be, thanks to its (soon) very complete test suite.

The tests depend on cppunit, a test library that helps you organise test into
suites and fixutres. You need cppunit 1.10 from cppunit.sf.net

By default, configure won't detect cppunit if it is not installed. So you must
run make -f Makefile.cvs in yzis in order to get the tests to compile and
linke correctly.

PhilAsserts and PhilTestRunner are a small addition to cppunit that I use to
improve the writing of the tests and the reporting of errors.
