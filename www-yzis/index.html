	<BR>
	<P>Until someone really works on this website, I'll just give the important informations :)<BR>
	
	<P>YZis is a new vim-like editor in which we intend to provide much more flexibility than Vim provide. 
	
	<P><b>YZis - Why this ?</b><br>
	After having work for quite some time on Vim's code (see the <a href=http://freehackers.org/kvim>KVim</a>
	project for more info) we arrived to the conclusion that Vim has never been really designed for GUIs and that 
	that point won't ever change (see the thread "Vim's future" in vim-dev@vim.org archives). 
	Our initial goal was to embed Vim inside KDE, which is at the time of this writing mostly done. 
	But the way it is currently done is just really ugly, slow as hell, featureless and a huge amount of 
	hacks. We are not satisfied enough with that :) (are we exigeant ? I guess yes ;p)
	<p>People are dreaming of a vi(m)-like editor fully incorporated into KDE, this is what this project aims at 
	creating.
	We do know this is a long and hard job to accomplish but we have good hopes of success :)<BR>
	We also hope we can 'bootstrap' ourselves really quick :)

	<P><b>Technical aspects</b><BR>
	We thought to YZis for quite a long time but most of the important part has been worked during FOSDEM 2003. 
	YZis comes as a C++ library in which the core of the editor will be. This lib will provide bindings for GUIs in C
	and in C++ so that different GUIs can be developped. Currently, ncurses and KDE are the test area though other GUIs
	should be esay to implement (yes, I know ncurses does not really looks like a GUI but we also want a console mode). 
	Possible GUIs includes GTK, Win32, MacOS ...<BR>

	<P><b>Just another editor ?</b><BR>
	We hope you won't think that for long :) Just give us some time to make the proof of it !

	<P><b>Who are 'we' ?</b><BR>
	'We' are Thomas Capricelli <A HREF=mailto:orzel@yzis.org><IMG HEIGHT=20 SRC=pics/orzel.png ALT="orzel"></A>
	and Mickael Marchand <A HREF=mikmak@yzis.org><IMG HEIGHT=20 SRC=pics/mikmak.png ALT="mikmak"></A><BR>

	<P><B>Need help ?</B><BR>
	Sure, anyone's welcome :).
	We would like to have other GUIs like GTK and Win32 for example and there is enough work for many people ;)
