To compile you need TinyQ (Tiny Qt) which is small part of the real Qt from Trolltech.
You need to compile it as shared and as a static lib. To do this you need to compile TinyQ twice (sorry for this).
First, configure it with -shared, compile, install it. Then make clean, configure it with -static, compile and install again 
over the previous installation, you should then have both libraries at the right places.

When configuring Yzis, use the --with-tinyq-dir to indicate your TinyQ prefix, QTDIR is used only for the real Qt needed for KYzis.
