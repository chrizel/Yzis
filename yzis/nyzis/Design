Nyzis is the ncurses-based gui for Yzis

It is different from the other gui implementation in that it is the main test case for
the core library. It's meant to be a reference implementation, and should be maintained 
by those patching the core library


It uses the c++ api


nyzis.h - classes definitions
main.cpp - Handles generic stuff (option parsing, object creation and such)
display.cpp - Display routines (mainly, NYZView implementation)
